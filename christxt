Dear Kristof, seems befitting to quote the founder of the internet and the most iconic evangelist of love
as a tribute to our leader and my friend :)
"The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past." Tim Berners Lee
"I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the water to create many ripples" Mother Theresa
Thank you for who you are and what you do for all of us...
